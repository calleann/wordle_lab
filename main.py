    This is a python implementation of the Wordle Game.

    Based on the online word game created and developed by Welsh software
    engineer Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word,
    with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating
    when letters match or occupy the correct position.

    The current version of this project is for education purposes.
